    "# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table\n",
    "Using the from <a href='https://taarifa.org/'>Taarifa</a> and the <a href='https://www.maji.go.tz/'>Tanzanian Ministry of Water</a>, I create several models to predict which water pumps are functional or not. To simplify the process, I will only work with two prediction labels: working and not working, and will apply all the underlying processes from a Machine Learning (ML) workflow standpoint. It is also important to understand which metric we are going to maximize, given the nature of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by introducing the problem, its stakeholders and why is it a relevant and what I am trying to achieve. Then I import the libraries that I am going to use - a combination of pandas and sklearn modules, and then I start basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cleaning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we prepare the date and use the training, testing splitting processes so I can inspect how the models will perform on both training and testing data. The notebook will provide three basic Machine Learning models and will also provide a workflow pipeline and an ensemble alternative at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I wrap up with the conclusion from this exercise and provide some recommendations about what I have discovered. Feel free to criticize, suggest improvements and interact. The dataset comes from DrivenData's Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table competition and can be found <a href='https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/'>here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Impoverished countries have difficulties in having access to clean water. Water poverty is responsible for a series of illnesses. Anecdotal evidence from the <a href='https://www.tanzaniawaterproject.org/how-were-making-a-difference/water-as-a-word-health-issue/'>Tanzanian Water Project</a> lists that:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>1/6 of the world population lack access to safe water;</li>\n",
    "    <li>88% of the diseases are caused by unsafe water drinking;</li>\n",
    "    <li>The average American uses 100-175 gallon of water daily, whereas the average African uses 5 gallon of water daily;</li>\n",
    "    <li>Water poverty negatively impacts education, local economies, agriculture and gender equality.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "Furthermore, it is estimated that people living in water poverty struck places usually have to walk around 3-5 miles per day to have access to questionable water supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the provided analysis does not solves the issue of lacking water wells in impoverished regions, I posit that having access to the status of a functioning well has its benefits. By having a predictive analysis that shows whether a well is properly functioning or not, public policy efforts can be driven to: fix that well, assess the quality of that well, and provide a better service to communities that use those wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders are the Tanzanian public policy makers and government, NGO's and the general public - not only the ones that use that well, but all the other communities and people interested. \n",
    "\n",

Population also does not provide too much useful information.\n",
