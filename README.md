# ML Project - Tanzanian Water Pump Status

## Overview

Using the from <a href='https://taarifa.org/'>Taarifa and</a> the <a href='https://www.maji.go.tz/'>Tanzanian Ministry of Water</a>, I create several models to predict which water pumps are functional or not. To simplify the process, I will only work with two prediction labels: functional and not functional, and will apply all the underlying processes from a Machine Learning (ML) workflow standpoint. 

## Business Problem

Impoverished countries have difficulties in having access to clean water. Water poverty is responsible for a series of illnesses. Anecdotal evidence from the <a href='https://www.tanzaniawaterproject.org/how-were-making-a-difference/water-as-a-word-health-issue/'>Tanzanian Water Project</a> lists that:
<ul>
    <li>1/6 of the world population lack access to safe water;</li>
    <li>88% of the diseases are caused by unsafe water drinking;</li>
    <li>The average American uses 100-175 gallon of water daily, whereas the average African uses 5 gallon of water daily;</li>
    <li>Water poverty negatively impacts education, local economies, agriculture and gender equality.</li>
</ul>
Furthermore, it is estimated that people living in water poverty struck places usually have to walk around 3-5 miles per day to have access to questionable water supply. 

The stakeholders are the Tanzanian public policy makers and government, NGO's and the general public - not only the ones that use that well, but all the other communities and people interested.

## Data and Analysis

The data can be found at <a href='https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/25/'>DrivenData</a>. Some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cleaning is performing on this dataset, as well joining its several sources. Most of the variables are categorical (i.e. dummies) and the final dataset has more than 55,000 rows.
